japacker.h - Just Another image Packer - A fast, efficient and easy to use packing library for texture atlas generation

This code is heavily commented and is intended to be easy to follow.

The problem: you want to pack as many images into a larger image, either to avoid image fragmentation (and many disk
accesses) or to help with rendering performance. What's the best way to go about it?

In japacker, the following approach is taken:

The destination image is composed of two different types of areas: areas that already have packed images in it, and
areas that are still empty.

In simple terms, the algorithm cycles through all empty areas (which are sorted from smallest to largest) until it
finds the smallest one in which the current image to pack (which are sorted from largest to smallest) will fit.

At first, the whole destination image is an empty area. After the first image is packed, starting at the top left,
the destination image then has one packed image and two empty areas, like so:

     ____________________
    |       |            |
    |   A   |            |        A - Packed rectangle
    |       |            |
    |_______|            |
    |       |      C     |        B - Smaller empty area
    |       |            |
    |   B   |            |
    |       |            |        C - Larger empty area
    |_______|____________|
     

If the next rectangle is small enough, it will be added to the top left side of the B empty area (which will then be
further divided in two), otherwise it will be added to the top left side of the C empty area.

The rects to be packed are represented by an array of japacker_rect's, which is as large as num_rects. The user will
fill each japacker_rect in the array with the width and height of each image to pack, and after running the algorithm
each japacker_rect will have the image's x and y position and whether it should be rotated (if the option is set).

The user is then free to use that x and y information to draw the actual image to the destination as they please.

The empty areas are represented by a double linked list which is based on an array of japacker_empty_area's.
When a new empty area is created, it is sorted in the array, from smallest to largest. This linked list sorting is what
makes the code efficient, because it allows for fast insertion and removal of elements in the middle of the list,
regardless of the fact that, in memory, the empty areas are actually stored sequentially.

Also, to save memory, empty areas are "repurposed" when an image is packed. As seen above, before the "A" rect was
packed, there was only a single empty area, which A then occupied a part of. The original empty area's spot in memory
was where "C" now resides, but the original empty area's x position and width was reduced to allow for the "A" image
and "B" empty area to have their own space. Conversely, the "B" empty area was created new (it's a new item in the
array), but it will also be repurposed as one of its smaller empty area when an image is added there.

Since an image can create, at most, one new empty area (since one of the two new empty areas is repurposed), then the
empty area's array only needs, at most, to be as large as the total number of images plus one.

This knowledge allows setting the full memory block for the empty areas in advance, preventing constant array
increases and memory reallocations, thus improving performance.

The code is thread safe: you can use two different japacker_t structs in two different threads. However, you should NOT
use the same japacker_t struct in two different threads, as that will cause problems.


***********************************************************************************************************************

Example usage:

// 1. Create a japacker_t struct
japacker_t packer;

// 2. Run your code to calculate the total number of rectangles to pack
unsigned int num_rectangles_to_pack = calculate_total_images_to_pack();

// 3. Initialize the struct, checking for errors
if (japacker_init(&packer, num_rectangles_to_pack, ATLAS_WIDTH, ATLAS_HEIGHT) != JAPACKER_OK) {
    printf("There was an error initting the packer.\n");
    return;
}

// 4. Set the desired options
packer.options.allow_rotation = 1;
packer.options.sort_by = JAPACKER_SORT_BY_AREA;

// 5. Get the source images' width and height
image_wh *image_dimensions_list = get_all_image_dimensions();

// 6. Fill the rect inputs with the width and height
for (int i = 0; i < num_rects; i++) {
    packer.rects[i].input.width = image_dimensions_list[i].width;
    packer_rects[i].input.height = image_dimensions_list[i].height;
}

// 7. Pack the images
int result = japacker_pack(&packer);

// 8. japacker_pack() returns a number below JAPACKER_OK on error
if (result < JAPACKER_OK) {
    printf("There was an error packing the images.\n");
    return;
}

// 9. japacker_pack() returns the number of actually packed images on success
if (result != num_rectangles_to_pack) {
    printf("Not all rects were packed, only %d of %d.\n", result, num_rectangles_to_pack);
} else {
    printf("All %d rects packed.\n", result);
}

// 10. Create the destination image
pixel_array *dst_image = create_destination_image(ATLAS_WIDTH, ATLAS_HEIGHT);

// 11. Draw the images
for (int i = 0; i < num_rectangles_to_pack; i++) {

    // The rects struct hasn't been reordered so the index of the images is still the same as before
    japacker_rect *rect = packer.rects[i];

    // 12. Only work with rectangles that were packed
    if (!rect->output.packed) {
        continue;
    }

    // 13. Draw the image, checking for rotation. When rotated, the rect->input.width and rect->input.height
    //     remain unchanged. It's up to you to actually rotate the image to the destination buffer
    draw_to_image(dst_image, get_single_image(i), rect->output.x, rect->output.y, rect->output.rotated);
}

// 14. Once the packer is used, free it
japacker_free(&packer);

 * This code works by finding the minimum possible area of the destination image (which is the sum of the areas of all
 * its rects), the area of the destination image set by the user, then, keep dividing the difference by two and
 * attempting to pack in a loop. The difference is divided by two for each pass of the loop.
 * 
 * If packing is successful, the current difference is subtracted to the width and height of the destination rectangle.
 * If it's unsuccessful, the difference is added.
 * 
 * This keeps happening until either the difference is smaller than 1 or there's a successful packing with a difference
 * of less than JAPACKER_TOLERABLE_AREA_DIFFERENCE_PERCENTAGE.
 * 
 * @param packer The packer in use.
 * @param rects_area The minimum possible area the destination image can have.
